# Sinon Intro

This is a simple demo setup of Sinon with Mocha and Chai. It relies on Node & npm being installed.

### Getting Started:
* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies with `npm install`

Run the notifier with `npm run start`, or run the tests with `npm run test`.

Note that both tests still print some text to the console - a fully mocked test shouldn't do that. Try adding an additional test that mocks both the email and tweet functionalities to prevent either message being printed.
